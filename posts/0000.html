            <p>
                I have been experimenting with using
                <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> for writing web servers.
                I enjoy doing low level programming, so I have not explored much
                of the work that has gone on in this area with Rust, such as
                <a href="https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs">Nickel</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/iron/iron">Iron</a>.
                I have instead opted to use
                <a href="https://github.com/tailhook/rotor-http">rotor-http</a>.
                Using rotor-http poses some challenges, as it is <em>very</em>
                barebones. As an example, when a form is submitted, we are given a byte
                array, which required writing a parser to utilize this data.</br></br>
                I have previously worked with <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>;
                mostly writing webservers. Working with Rust has been a completely
                different experience. As an example, in Go if I wish to redirect a user,
                I can do something like <code>http.Redirect(w, r, "/", 302)</code>.
                In Rust I wrote this function:</br>
                <pre><code>pub fn redirect(res: &mut Response, data: &[u8],
                location: &[u8], code: u16)
    -> Result<(), String> {
    let message = match code_lookup(code) {
        Some(m) => m,
        None => return Err("Code not found!".to_string()),
    };

    res.status(code, message);
    res.add_header("Location", location).unwrap();
    res.add_length(data.len() as u64).unwrap();
    if res.done_headers().unwrap() {
        res.write_body(data);
    }
    res.done();
}</code></pre>

                At this point, I am able to simply call <code>redirect(res, b"Redirect", b"/", 302)</code>;
                which is about as easy as what Go does. I've created <a href="https://github.com/nokaa/rotor-http-utils">a library</a> that contains a number of helpful functions for working with rotor-http, such as for parsing form data.</br></br>
                In conclusion, Rust is definitely capable of use for web servers, although it may require
                a lot of extra work. As Rust matures even further, and the community creates more libraries,
                this situation will only improve.
