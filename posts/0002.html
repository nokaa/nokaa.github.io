            <p>
                In <a href="https://nokaa.moe/posts/0000.html">my first post</a> I wrote about
                using Rust for web servers. I talked a little bit about Golang there, and I
                thought that it may be interesting to write about it.

                <h4 class="c">My Experience With Golang</h4>

                I began working with Golang in July of 2015 (about 8 months ago). At the time,
                I was attending a Hackathon and had no idea what to work on. I had heard quite
                a lot about Golang on Hacker News and it sounded like a nice language.<br><br>

                At this time my experience was limited to NodeJS and C. I really liked writing C,
                but I was not capable of writing anything "cool". NodeJS made writing servers easy,
                and servers are pretty cool. Golang looked and felt similar to C, and it also
                made writing servers easy. It was even easier to write than C, due to garbage
                collection.<br><br>

                At the time it seemed to hit a lot of good points. I started going through
                <a href="https://tour.golang.org">the tour</a> on the way to the hackathon, and
                found that the language felt nice to work with. I worked with it during the
                hackathon; and grew to love it. By the time I was home, I had completely
                forgotten about NodeJS and C; Golang was my new love.<br><br>

                Over the next several months I worked on a number of small projects using Golang;
                such as a blog and a pastebin clone. That is to say, I have experience with using
                Golang for nontrivial projects that I use everyday; but I do not have experience
                using Golang with other developers. Also, none of my projects are larger than 1000-2000
                lines of code.

                <h4 class="c">What I Like About Golang</h4>

                I really like how <em>fun</em> it is to write software with Golang. Every time I work
                with it, I find myself enjoying what I'm writing. That's something that only a handful
                of languages really have. I get the same feeling from working with Rust, Scheme, and
                <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>.<br><br>

                I love <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">Bolt</a>. Bolt is an embedded key/value
                database in pure Golang. What this means is that you don't have to deal with setting up a
                database, and you don't have to write any funny queries. Bolt creates a file on your disk,
                and you do your database operations in pure Golang. This is very convenient for small
                projects because it makes setup far easier; just <code>go get; go build</code>! It is also
                nice that it works anywhere Go works, I use ARM based servers so I never know if software
                will work. I really wish that Rust had something similar to Bolt.<br><br>

                I think that one of Golang's best features is how strong its networking support is. Writing
                servers is extremely easy using only the standard library. It is also very fast and low on
                memory, which is a rare thing for servers that are often written in languages such as Python,
                Ruby, and Java. The complete lack of support in Rust is a little disheartening, but not
                unexpected. It seems like the community is doing a good job of filling this gap anyways.

                <h4 class="c">What I Dislike About Golang</h4>

                Oh yes, the part that everyone has been waiting for: it's hate on Golang time! First on the
                list: everyone always complains about Golang. I used to pay attention to what people were
                saying about Golang; but after a few months I stopped. Everything about Golang was
                <em>it's bad</em> or <em>it won't be big</em>; it becomes tiring rather fast.<br><br>
                
                Golang is not the perfect language, no language can fill that role. However, Golang is very
                well suited for a number of tasks. The idea of worrying about how popular Golang is seems
                rather absurd. For one thing, it's backed by Google. It's hard to get a bigger vote of
                confidence than that. Even ignoring that, if no one uses Golang, it can never become popular,
                which just gives us an endless loop.<br><br>

                Unlike most people, I do not dislike how Golang does error handling. I prefer how Rust
                and Haskell do this, but it is nice not working with try-catch or worrying about a panic.
                Lack of generics is annoying but I have fortunately not had to deal with this.<br><br>

                Ultimately, my only major complaint about Golang deals with verbosity. Golang reminds me
                of Java in how verbose it is. It often takes a lot of code to do something that feels
                trivial. In the end, this isn't much of a complaint. Despite this issue Golang continues
                to be fun to work with, which for me is in stark contrast to my experience with Java.

                <h4 class="c">Why Did I Stop Working With Golang?</h4>

                The only real answer is that I haven't. I think that Golang is very well suited to writing
                servers, and I plan to continue to use it for this purpose. I've worked with Golang much less lately
                because my interests have changed. Lately I have been much more interested in creating
                tools and writing low-level code; and I feel that Rust is often better suited for this purpose.
                Ultimately, if I were offered a job working with Golang I would gladly accept. I think that's
                a really good test; <em>would you work with this language every day?</em> If you can answer
                <em>yes</em>, you must not dislike the language <b>that</b> much.

                <h4 class="c">Conclusion</h4>

                In the end, this ended up being a post about what I wish Rust would learn from Golang, but that
                isn't such a bad thing is it?
