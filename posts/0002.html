            <p>
                In <a href="https://nokaa.moe/posts/0000.html">my first post</a> I wrote about
                using Rust for web servers. I talked a little bit about Golang there, and I
                thought that it may be interesting to write about it.

                <h4 class="c">My Experience With Golang</h4>
                I began working with Golang in July of 2015 (about 8 months ago). At the time,
                I was attending a Hackathon and had no idea what to work on. I had heard quite
                a lot about Golang on Hacker News and it sounded like a nice language.<br><br>

                At this time my experience was limited to NodeJS and C. I really liked writing C,
                but I was not capable of writing anything "cool". NodeJS made writing servers easy,
                and servers are pretty cool. Golang looked and felt similar to C, and it also
                made writing servers easy. It was even easier to write than C, due to garbage
                collection.<br><br>

                At the time it seemed to hit a lot of good points. I started going through
                <a href="https://tour.golang.org">the tour</a> on the way to the hackathon, and
                found that the language felt nice to work with. I worked with it during the
                hackathon; and grew to love it. By the time I was home, I had completely
                forgotten about NodeJS and C; Golang was my new love.<br><br>

                Over the next several months I worked on a number of small projects using Golang.
                I wrote a simple blog software and a simple pastebin clone; both of which I
                continue to use on a different website. I also wrote a small program to send SMS
                messages to attendees of a hackathon I helped organize.
