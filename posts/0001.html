                One of my favorite things to create is tools. I enjoy creating tools that make
                it more convenient for myself and other developers to work. I also enjoy talking
                with other developers about what tools that they use. You never know when you
                might learn about a new tool. Too that end, here are some of the tools that I use
                to cast my spells.<br><br>

                <h4>Computer</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>ArchLinux</li>
                    <li>13" Apple Macbook Pro</li>
                    <li>Ducky mechanical keyboard with blue switches</li>
                    <li>Kensington Expert Trackball</li>
                </ul>

                My environment consists of Awesomewm, Firefox, ZSH+prezto, and Neovim.<br>
                My Awesome install is mostly stock, although I'm interested in working with it more.<br>
                My Firefox install uses a number of add-ons to remove the cruft that developers seem to
                enjoy adding to simple websites. Some of these are uBlock, Noscript, and VimFX.<br>
                I initially used a stock ZSH install, but I've recently begun using prezto. I've found that
                having git information and auto-correct is very useful. I plan to explore what else it is capable
                of.<br>
                My Neovim install is also very barren. I don't use many plugins, most of the plugins I use simply
                add syntax highlighting. The most featured plugin I use is the Go plugin, which runs <code>go fmt</code>
                every time I save.<br><br>

                I have made many of <a href="https://git.nokaa.moe/nokaa/dotfiles">my configuration files</a>
                available, and I have also made <a href="https://git.nokaa.moe/nokaa/prezto">my changes to prezto</a> available.
