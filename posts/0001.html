            <p>
                One of my favorite things to create is tools. I enjoy creating tools that make
                it more convenient for myself and other developers to work. I also enjoy talking
                with other developers about what tools that they use. You never know when you
                might learn about a new tool. Too that end, here are some of the tools that I use
                to cast my spells.<br><br>

                <h4 class="c">Computer</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>ArchLinux</li>
                    <li>13" Apple Macbook Pro</li>
                    <li>Ducky mechanical keyboard with blue switches</li>
                    <li>Kensington Expert Trackball</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="c">Software</h4>
                My environment consists of Awesomewm, Firefox, ZSH+prezto, and Neovim.<br><br>

                My Awesome install is mostly stock, although I'm interested in working with it more.<br><br>

                My Firefox install uses a number of add-ons to remove the cruft that developers seem to
                enjoy adding to simple websites. Some of these are uBlock, Noscript, and VimFX. If you are
                one of these developers who thinks requiring me to allow JavaScript to view your shitty
                blog is acceptable; you need to step away from the keyboard and think about what you're doing.<br><br>

                I initially used a stock ZSH install, but I've recently begun using prezto. I've found that
                having git information and auto-correct is very useful. I plan to explore what else it is capable
                of.<br><br>

                My Neovim install is also very barren. I don't use many plugins, most of the plugins I use simply
                add syntax highlighting. The most featured plugin I use is the Go plugin, which runs <code>go fmt</code>
                every time I save.<br><br>

                I suppose that my choice of tools shows that I am a fan of minimalism. I really like tools that allow me
                to work without moving my hands off of the keyboard. I really prefer to see plain-text; I don't think that
                it is really necessary to have a bunch of bells and whistles to read documentation. That isn't to say that
                I do not appreciate I nice user interface; after all my website would work just as well if it were
                plain text. It is all about striking the right balance between utility and niceties.<br><br>

                I have made many of <a href="https://git.nokaa.moe/nokaa/dotfiles">my configuration files</a>
                available, and I have also made <a href="https://git.nokaa.moe/nokaa/prezto">my changes to prezto</a> available.
