            <p>
                I think about how to make good tools pretty often, and I've
                decided to write some of my thoughts here. I am going to
                analogize common text editors to weapons in an RPG to explain.
                <br><br>

                I would like to say that this is not meant to disparage your
                favorite editor. I have used all of these editors, and they're
                all great. You should use what you like. Except Notepad.
                Don't use Notepad.

                <h5 class="c">Notepad</h5>
                <i>Notepad</i> is the weapon that you start the game with. Sure
                it can get the job done, kind of<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
                However, most people throw it away as soon as they can.

                <h5 class="c">Sublime Text</h5>
                <i>Sublime Text</i> is like the first decent weapon you pick
                up. It's made for beginners and it works really well for a
                while. You can even enchant it to make it a little more
                powerful! However, you quickly reach its limits and yearn
                for something stronger.

                <h5 class="c">Vim</h5>
                <i>Vim</i> is a weapon made by experts, for experts. You need
                a high skill level to make use of it, but it works very well
                for those with the experience to wield it. With enough money,
                you can add a lot of powerful enchantments to it which greatly
                enhance its strength. However, its high requirements mean that
                many adventurers are unable to ever feel its power.

                <h5 class="c">Emacs</h5>
                <i>Emacs</i> is the weapon that you get very early on as an
                ultra-rare drop. It's pretty powerful to begin with, but it
                is also <i>alive</i>. Just like you, Emacs gains experience as
                you use it, thus allowing it to grow with you, even going
                toe-to-toe with expert weapons. This is the weapon everyone
                dreams of getting.
                <br><br>
                Another way of thinking about Emacs is that it is the
                custom-order weapon that exactly suits your needs. This
                analogy works well as an expert, but most beginners don't
                have the cash to buy custom-order weapons.

                <h4 class="c">Conclusion</h4>
                From the above, it may seem as though I am saying that
                everyone should be using Emacs. This is not the case. I use
                Vim, not Emacs. I think that with current hardware; i.e.
                keyboard and mouse; modal editing is superior. Emacs is slow
                and kind of bloated; this is why I decided to learn Vim over
                Emacs.
                <br><br>
                Despite this, I think that Emacs is the superior tool. In Emacs
                I can create modal editing; <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a>
                has already done this. I think that good tools should be easy
                for a beginner to use, but they should also have the ability
                to grow with the user.
                <br><br>

                I think that Sublime Text fails this
                in a number of ways; I can't exactly use Sublime Text on a
                headless unit can I? It's also proprietary software, so if
                I really dislike some part of it, I'm just screwed. Basically,
                Sublime Text doesn't grow well.
                <br><br>

                Vim also fails, largely because it is very difficult for
                beginners to use. Most people can sit down with Sublime Text or
                Emacs and just start typing. In Vim, you have to learn how to
                enter Insert mode before you can even type! I also think that
                Vimscript is a large negative, it can make it annoying to expand
                the editor's abilities. Rather than just casting
                <i>Enchant Item</i>, you have to sacrifice a goat in a satanic
                circle to enchant it.
                <br><br>

                I think that a lot of things can be improved with our current
                set of tools, but even within the realm of text editors there
                is plenty of room for improvement.

                    <a href="#1">[1]</a> The fact that Notepad only reads
                    newlines as <code>\r\n</code> can be really annoying if
                    you open a file created on a Unix machine.
