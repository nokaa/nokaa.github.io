            <p>
                Lately I have been thinking a lot about the tools that I
                use for programming. What is good about them, in what ways
                do they fall short, that type of thing. I'm starting to
                notice a lot of interesting things.<br><br>

                One area that is seriously lacking is hardware. The hardware
                tools that we use to create software have stayed basically
                the same for the last several decades. Why is this? I find
                it unlikely that we managed to stumble upon the best
                configuration so soon.<br><br>

                Something that I've heard almost nothing about is the usage
                of our feet. Why don't we use our feet to aide in development?
                Many people have problems with hand/wrist strain due to using
                keys in odd spaces; e.g. Emacs users with control. Why don't
                we use foot pedals to control these odd keys? I set out to do
                just this.
