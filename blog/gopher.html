            <p>
                I recently wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_protocol">
                    gopher</a> server in Rust using
                    <a href="https://github.com/tailhook/rotor">rotor</a>.
                Gopher is an interesting net protocol of old that can be
                    considered a predecessor to HTTP. It has been largely
                    abandoned, however a number of enthusiasts still run
                    servers, such as <a href="http://blog.z3bra.org/2015/02/do-you-gopher.html">
                    z3bra</a> and <a href="https://arcetera.moe/blog/2016/03/02/gopher-in-2016/">ix</a>.<br><br>
                
                After reading about the protocol and looking at what other
                    people were doing, I decided to set up my own server. I
                    thought that writing a gopher server would be a good
                    project to learn more about TCP and rotor without
                    spending too much time. I also learned how to follow
                    a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1436">
                    specification</a> from this project.

                I decided to build it on top of rotor because, other than
                mio, it is the only library I know of in Rust for working
                with TCP. Rotor also has the advantage of async, which is
                always welcome.
